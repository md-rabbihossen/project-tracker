# ✅ ISSUE FIXED - Column Name Mismatch

## 🔍 Problem:

```
Error: "Could not find the 'name' column of 'users' in the schema cache"
```

## 🎯 Root Cause:

**Mismatch between database schema and JavaScript code:**

- **Database:** Column is `user_name` (in SQL)
- **JavaScript:** Code was using `name` (in supabase.js)

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### Changed in `src/services/supabase.js`:

**Before (line 438):**

```javascript
async createOrUpdateUser(userId, name) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from("users").upsert({
    user_id: userId,
    name: name,  // ❌ Wrong column name
  });
}
```

**After (FIXED):**

```javascript
async createOrUpdateUser(userId, userName) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from("users").upsert({
    user_id: userId,
    user_name: userName,  // ✅ Correct column name
  });
}
```

## 🚀 Test Now:

1. **Clear localStorage:**

   - Press F12 → Application → Local Storage → Clear All
   - Refresh page (Ctrl+R)

2. **Test login:**

   - Click "Generate New User ID"
   - Enter a name (e.g., "Rahat")
   - Click Generate

3. **Expected console output:**

   ```
   ✅ User created successfully in database
   🎉 Login successful! User ID: [your-uuid]
   ```

4. **Verify in Supabase:**
   - Go to Table Editor → users table
   - You should see 1 row with:
     - `user_id`: Your UUID
     - `user_name`: "Rahat" (or whatever you entered)

## 📊 What Should Work Now:

- ✅ Generate new User ID
- ✅ User is saved to Supabase database
- ✅ Login with existing User ID
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Profile menu shows User ID
- ✅ Logout button works

---

## 🎉 Success Checklist:

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Login page appears
- [ ] "Generate New User ID" works without errors
- [ ] Console shows: "✅ User created successfully in database"
- [ ] User appears in Supabase `users` table
- [ ] User ID is visible in profile menu
- [ ] No 400 or 401 errors in console
- [ ] App loads after login

## 🔄 What Was The Full Issue Chain?

1. **Original SQL** had JWT-based RLS policies → Blocked inserts (401 Unauthorized)
2. **Fixed RLS** with UUID-based policies → Allowed inserts
3. **Column name mismatch** → Database has `user_name`, code used `name` (400 Bad Request)
4. **Final fix** → Changed JavaScript to use `user_name`

---

## 📝 Files Changed:

1. ✅ `FRESH_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` - Correct RLS policies
2. ✅ `src/services/supabase.js` - Fixed column name from `name` to `user_name`

**Status: FIXED! Test it now!** 🚀

If you see **"✅ User created successfully in database"** in console, you're good to go! 🎉
